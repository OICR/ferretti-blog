> "Dear Diary,

> Today's the one-month anniversary of my first experience with Agile Scrum!!  And what a whirlwind it's been!  My company transitioned pretty quickly from waterfall to Scrum.  Made a whole big announcement with much fanfare a while ago.  Claimed it was the hot trend, where every software company was going.  Apparently some of our company bigwigs did some research - You know, Googled some stuff, watched some YouTube videos, learned some buzzwords.  We're so ready for this, they said we don't even need trainers or coaches!

> So here we are, finally doing it!  I mean really doing it.  This Agile thing.  The Agile.  The Scrum.  And every person has fallen in love with it so far.  I think.  I mean, it's kind of felt like a shotgun romance - The thrilling honeymoon period, the rush of excitement.  Yeah!  I mean, look at all the fabulous things we're doing:

> * We get to write these amazing, page-long Epics and paragraph-long User Stories to give developers cool requirements!
> * We have these daily half-hour standups with geographically-dispersed teams where we really get to know each other!  It's weird though, we don't ever video conference.
> * When requirements aren't clear or complete, the developers just say they can't do any work yet.  Very logical right?  Forces the business analysts (BAs) get their act together.
> * We use JIRA to track everything!  Epics, stories, tasks, tests, you name it.  I wish there was a way we could *VISUALIZE* our progress though.

> Hmmm...but now that I'm here writing my deepest feelings to you...Diary, am I rushing headlong into a relationship without really knowing what the other party is about?  Am I building the right foundation for love?  Have I jumped into this too quickly, thinking with heart and not my head?..."

Before I joined the <OICR Software Engineering Team>, *THAT* was what I thought Agile Scrum was.  It was the only experience I'd ever known.  The participants in that story (myself included), did many, many things wrong.  But that's a blog post for another time, another place.

I was lucky enough that OICR took a chance on me.  After I joined, my entire worldview on software development was completely changed.  I don't exaggerate when I say that my eyes were once shut, but now they are wide open.

To casual outsiders, hearing offhand about our organization may conjure up images of stuffy academics, cancer researchers, and data scientists in lab coats, too inflexible to ever implement a framework like Agile.

How wrong they would be.  Here at OICR, we develop software just as, if not more, efficiently and nimbly as many corporate environments.  Do we face challenges?  Most certainly.  As a non-profit we often work with even more limited resources than others.  Our systems deal with massive amounts of big data, ranging from clinical to genomic.  We receive complex requirements across the entire software stack, from the front-end web portals (UX and UI) to the back-end infrastructure (datastore, ETL, workflow systems).

But we remain dynamic and adaptable.  We design and build fast.  We test new ideas quickly.  We iterate - Over and over.  We always strive to be creative and think outside the box.  And we aren't afraid to make mistakes and learn from them.
   
# To Be (Or Not To Be) a Scrum Master

Here, I was finally taught how to do Scrum the proper way.  But it was hard at first.  Really hard.  It was like learning to walk again.  Shedding old, bad habits isn't easy.  Thankfully I have some wonderful and patient mentors who guided me along the way (quick thanks to Rosi, my mentor and BA-partner-in-crime; and to Francois, our brilliant alumni project manager!). 

5 months ago I was asked to try on the role of Scrum master for our <GDC Portal> team.  It was a golden opportunity but also had me scared sleepless!  Taking it has been one of the best growth phases of my career.  I procrastinated writing this post for a loooooonnnnggg time, because I wanted to have enough "flight experience" to share something useful.

So here we are 5 months later, and I'm excited to share some of the most useful (and painful) lessons I've learned as a rookie Scrum master.  In the hopes that it can help other rookies (or even vets) joining the league.

# 1. Keep Your Standup Integrity!

> "Diary Dearest,"

# 2. Don't Make it *ALL* About the Burndown

> "My Beloved Diary,"

# 3. Drop In, Not Over

> "Bestest Diary in this Universe,"

> "Some people learn to lose, others lose and learn."
> "Do the things that only you can do."
> "Your best opportunity may also be your last opportunity, so make the most of it."

# 4. Retros Don't Always Need Actions

> "Hey D,"

# 5. Put People First

> "Dear Diary,"

This really should be #1.  But most important last ???
