CSS-in-JS. A phrase which splits opinion in two nearly as much as how delicious cilantro is.

SASS. BEM. Modules. There are many approaches to styling modern apps. But for me CSS-in-JS takes the cilantro. I mean cake.

I will present, to you the reader, a grab bag of opinions on why you might want to consider using it and share with you some reasons why I like using it.

This article mostly targets React web apps using Emotion 10.

# The new 'in' thing

CSS-in-JSS is just that. Instead of writing rule ridden CSS stylesheets we now write javascript functions which will return us styled components. CSS modules allowed us to co-locate our styles with our components but now we can go a step further and write our styles completely inline with our components. This benefits code organisation. We are also scoping our styles to our components, instead of polluting a global scope. If we delete our component, the styles go to. No more useless styles hanging out after midnight and bloating our precious bundle size for first render.

# Constants

It's just javascript.
It's easy to define constant variables and share them amongst files. It could be a colour, it could be a margin, heck it could even be a blinking animation you want to use on every single clickable element because you miss `<blink>` so much.

Theming. Uses cases. Accessibility.

# What's in a name?

The book industry is filled with shelves upon shelves of ideas for baby names. Naming is hard. CSS naming is no exception. The faster I am able to quickly write a component without worrying about a classname css selector.
We can use inline styles and avoid writing class names:

```
<div style={{fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: '22px'}}>Inline react style</div>
```

Using this approach we're constrained to this awful halfway mark between an object and CSS properties. Remembering to camel case properties and use strings for number values when our head is in CSS world constantly trips me up. CSS-in-JS provides a more natural inline style for us and it even comes with syntax highlighting in VSCode!

```
<div css={css`font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px`}>A quite interesting heading</div>
```

# Emotional Rescue

Typescript
Code examples

vs

```
<div className='heading slightly-more-styled-heading'>A sufficintly interesting heading</div>
```

Then in some long forgotten file dealing with

```
.heading {
    font-weight: bold;
}

.slightly-more-styled-heading {
    font-size: 22px
}
```
