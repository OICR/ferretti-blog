## Engineering Pedigree

Before going into the how, it is important to acknowledge the mountain of work and talent we were already standing on when embarking on this latest project. Software and tools that were first developed going back 7 years were repurposed from cancer research for use in this solution. Our teams adherence to open source, pushing ourselves to make our tools reusable, and overall project vision, coallesed with the talent we have build up in all areas from business analysis to bioinformatics. This allowed us to achieve something special under an otherwise impossible timeline. 

## The Ask

!!! Describe the requirements / what was asked of us as well as the timeline. 

## The Breakdown

    <figcaption>It is one heck of a "bunch".</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! How we broke it down to an mvp set of features, broke up the tasks of deploying infrastrcture, 
understanding what can be reused from Overture, and what had to be green field developed. 

## Project Management and Agility

!!! Talk about how adapted existing methodology, switch from spring to kanban, and kept a high tempo of tickets. 

## Powered By Overture

Our flagship software suite for big-data genomics, [Overture.bio](https://www.overture.bio/), recently received a lot of love and care thanks to funding from [Canarie](https://www.canarie.ca/). Various aspects of the software suite had been polished and matured, and combined with our experience building other data portals and platforms, we were able to use Overture essentially out of the box to provide realtime data storage, cataloging, and search. 

## A Fresh Face

!!! Design work and forking and customization of DMS-UI

## Muse: Realtime genomic data and metadata processing

!!! Talk about muse

## Devops in the Cloud.

!!! Shoutout to collab, talk about kubernetes, CI/CD with Jenkins, terraform of helm. 

## Crunch Time during Covid

!!! Acknoweldge a project like this has a crunch near the end but in this case it may have been the whole month and how the Covid lockdown made things harder like loss of boundaries between work and life. 

## Final Thoughts and Acknowledgements

!!! Acknowledgements to past and present staff and any final thoughts and lessons learned.
