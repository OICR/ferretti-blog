We are using `kramdown` markdown converter. You can find out more about it here [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org). We highly recommend going through its syntax documentation
to get yourself more familiar with the coding style.

#### Support for multiple authors

Replace 'author' in the blog post with an array of authors like this:
```
authors:
    - firstname_lastname
    - firstname_lastname
    - firstname_lastname
```

##### Images

Images can be added as an absolute or a relative link. You can look at kramdown syntax documentation to find out about adding absolute links. For a relative link images you can upload them into your folder inside images directory `/images/firstname_lastname/image.png`

To refer them inside your blog post, use the image url from the site config as `{{ site.urlimg }}` and append relative link of your image. `{{ site.urlimg }}/firstname_lastname/image.png`

### Sync your new branch with Github

At regular interval, push your content to Github.

```
git commit -a -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```

### Create a Pull Request

Once your content is ready for review, create a pull request from your new branch towards gh-pages.

https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

### Update blog content (non-posts)

Blog data (projects, team members, positions, ...) are located in `/_data/`, please edit those files in your own branch and submit pull requests towards gh-pages.
